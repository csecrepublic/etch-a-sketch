# One-Liner
A continuous line-drawing desktop app.

## Description
One-Liner is a continuous line-drawing application for desktop use. The user can pick a color from the color menu, then begin drawing using mouseover (like an Etch-a-Sketch).

This site was a riff on The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project (linked below). I practiced using event listeners, manipulating the DOM, and other basic front-end skills.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Issues & ideas
* Optimize for mobile
* Add an eraser button (hack: use the white pen to "erase" other colors!)
* Create separate classes for elements (Color, Color Bar, Grid, etc.) 

## Instructions
No installation required. Just follow this [link to the GitHub Pages site](https://csecrepublic.github.io/one-liner/).
